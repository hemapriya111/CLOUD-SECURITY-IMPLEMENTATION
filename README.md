The goal of this task was to implement key cloud security components, including IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies, secure storage configurations, and data encryption mechanisms, using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.

Implementation Steps

IAM Policy Creation: Created custom IAM policies using the AWS IAM console in JSON format. Example policy allowed listing IAM users and policies: Assigned this policy to a custom IAM role to practice fine-grained permission control.

Secure Cloud Storage (AWS S3): Created an Amazon S3 bucket for secure file storage. Configured bucket policies and block public access settings to restrict unauthorized access. Enabled versioning and logging for data traceability and rollback.

Data Encryption: Enabled default encryption using AWS-managed KMS keys for all objects stored in the S3 bucket. Verified that uploaded files are encrypted at rest using SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys).

Outcome and Skills Gained: Gained hands-on experience with IAM policy syntax (JSON) and permission structure. Learned how to enforce secure access control and limit user permissions. Understood how to apply data-at-rest encryption and follow best practices for secure S3 bucket configuration. Strengthened knowledge in cloud security fundamentals critical for real-world deployments.
